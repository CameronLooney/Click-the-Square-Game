## Description
A simple python game using tkinter and classes to implement
When you start the game you will be given multiple versions to choose from aswell as shapes and colours. 
The basic version is simply clicking the shape as it appears
In the advanced version clicking the shape when blue will lose a life
Cyan will reset the speed (which gets progressively faster as your score increases)
Gold will give double points
The objective is simply to get the highest score you can
## Focus
The main focus was getting a clear understanding of tkinter and implementing a working model of it. Understanding how the GUI interacts with classes was very benefical and I learned alot from it
